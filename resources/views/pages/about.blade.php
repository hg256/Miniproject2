            <h3>If you’ve never owned a car from Ford or Toyota or Honda, you’ve probably considered them at some point. Both manufacturers offer a wide range of vehicle types; their lineups include a mix of old standbys and fresh new options.<br>

                <br>Ford and Toyota both boast longevity in the market and loyal customers. Deciding on the better brand for you will probably depend on the type of vehicle you want to buy.<br>

                <br>Using the safety and reliability data on our site, as well as U.S. News scoring in major vehicle classes, we can help you narrow down the search for your next new vehicle.<br>

                <br>Keep in mind that the scores on our site are updated constantly as new expert reviews and data become available. Therefore, the scores mentioned in this slideshow may not match the scores in our reviews.<br>
                <br>For buyers who favor import nameplates, the purchase decision often comes down to this: Will it be a Toyota or Honda? Does one of these car companies deserve more consideration than the other?<br>
